      <t>The Special-Use Domain Names registration policy in RFC 6761 has been
      shown through experience to present unanticipated challenges. This memo
      presents a list, intended to be comprehensive, of the problems that have
      been identified.   In addition it reviews the history of Domain Names
      and summarizes current IETF and non-IETF publications relating on special-use
      domain names.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
    
      <t>One of the key services required to use the Internet is name resolution.
      Name resolution is the process of translating a human-readable symbolic
      name into some object or set of objects to which the name refers, perhaps
      most typically one or more IP addresses.  These names are often referred
      to as domain names, although in this document they will be referred to
      as internet names to avoid confusion between the names and a particular
      protocol for resolving these names, the <xref target="RFC1034">Domain
      Name System</xref>.</t>
    
      <t>At the time of this writing, the IETF has recently been asked to
      allocate several new special-use top-level internet names. In evaluating the
      process for additional special-use-top-level internet names as documented in
      <xref target="RFC6761">Special-Use Domain Names</xref>, the IETF
      encountered several different sorts of issues. Because of this, the IETF
      has decided to investigate the problem and decide if and how the RFC
      6761 process can be improved, or whether it should be deprecated.</t>

      <t>This document presents a list, believed to be complete, of the
      problems associated with the allocation of special-use names.
      In support of the particular set of problems described here,
      the document also includes documentation of existing practice as
      it relates to the use of internet names, as well as a brief history of
      domain names, and finally to describe the set of problems that exist as
      reported by various IETF participants with experience in the various
      aspects of the problem.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>For the sake of brevity this document uses a number of abbreviations.
      These are expanded here: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Internet Name">A name which serves as input to a host's
          ordinary name resolution process, for example 'EXAMPLE.ORG'.</t>

          <t hangText="SUIN">Special Use Internet Name</t>

          <t hangText="SUTLIN">Special-Use Top-Level Internet Name</t>

          <t hangText="IANA">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</t>

          <t hangText="ICANN">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
          Numbers</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Problems associated with Special-Use Internet Names">
      <t>This section presents a list of problems that have been identified
      with respect to the allocation of special-use names.   Solutions to
      these problems are out of scope.   Because of that, problems with
      solutions to these problems are also out of scope, and will be covered
      in a separate document.</t>
      
      <t>No assertion
      is made that any of these problems is more or less important than any
      other. The point of this is simply to enumerate and briefly describe
      the problems that have been raised during the discussion of the
      special-use name problem.   The degree of detail is intended to be
      sufficient that that participants in the discussion can agree that the
      problems they've raised have been adequately described, and no more.</t>
      
      <t>In addition, no assertion is made that all of these problems must be
      addressed; while each problem has one or more solutions, the solutions
      may in some cases be mutually contradictory, or may come with costs that
      do not justify the benefit that would be obtained from solving them.</t>
      
      <t>This is the list of problems:<list style="symbols">
        <t>IETF and ICANN independently have remit to assign names out
        of the same namespace; a formal coordination process does not exist.</t>

        <t>Although IETF and ICANN nominally have control of the namespace,
        neither organization can enforce that control over any third party
        who wants to just start using a subset of the namespace.</t>

        <t>The namespace is useful for identifying things outside of the
        scope of the Domain Name System.</t>

        <t>The IETF process for assigning names to things outside of the
          DNS is tortuous</t>

        <t>There is strong resistance within the IETF to assigning names
        to things outside of the DNS, for a variety of reasons:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Requires a mechanism for identifying which of a set of
          resolution processes is required in order to resolve a
          particular name.</t>

          <t>Assertion of authority: there is a sense that the namespace
          is "owned" by the IETF or by ICANN, and so if a name is allocated
          outside of that process, the person or entity that allocated that
          name should suffer some consequence that would, presumably, deter
          future circumvention of the official process.</t>

          <t>More than one protocol is bad, in the sense that a single
          protocol is less complicated to implement and deploy.</t>

          <t>If there is an IETF process through which a name
          can be allocated at zero cost other than time, this process will
          be used to circumvent the ICANN gTLD process.</t>

          <t>Some names that might be allocated would be sufficiently generic
          that other legitimate uses of those names would overlap with a
          proposed use, so that assigning the name would preclude some future,
          better use of it.</t>
          
          <t>If the IETF allocates a name that some third party or parties 
          believes belongs to them in some way, the IETF could become embroiled
          in an expensive dispute with those parties.</t></list></t>
          
        <t>In cases where assignments have been made, technical mistakes have
        been made due either to insufficiently well-defined process or to a
        failure to follow the process that was defined.</t>
        
        <t>In cases where names have been marked as unsafe to allocate, the
        actual uses of those names that led to the potential for conflict have
        not been documented.</t>
        
        <t>No process exists for checking documents to make sure they don't
        accidentally assign names (e.g. RFC 7788).</t>

        <t>Use of the registry is inconsistent--some SUTLIN RFCs specify registry
        entries; some don't; some specify delegation, some don't.</t>
        
        <t>There exists no safe, non-process-violating mechanism for ad-hoc
        allocation of special-use names.</t></list></t>
        
      <t>The problems we have stated here represent the current understanding of
      the authors of the document as to the complete set of problems that have been
      identified during discussion by the working group on this topic.   The
      remainder of this document provides additional context that will be needed
      for reasoning about these problems.</t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Existing Practice Regarding SUINs">
      <t>There are three primary and numerous secondary documents to consider
      when thinking about the Special-Use Internet Names process.</t>

      <section title="Primary SUIN Documents">
        <t>The primary documents are considered primary because they directly
        address the IETF's past thoughts on this topic in a general way, and
        also because they describe what the IETF does in practice. Only one of
        these documents is an IETF consensus document.</t>

        <section title="IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root">
          <t><xref target="RFC2826">This document</xref> is not an IETF
          consensus document, and appears to have been written to address a
          different problem than the SUIN problem. However, it speaks directly
          to several of the key issues that must be considered, and of course
          coming as it does from the IAB, it is rightly given with a great
          deal of authority despite not being an IETF consensus document.</t>

          <t>This document should be considered required reading for IETF
          participants who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of
          SUINs. The main points that appear relevant to the specal use names
          problem are: <list style="symbols">
              <t>The Internet requires a globally unique namespace</t>

              <t>Private networks may operate private namespaces, but still
              require that names in the public namespace be globally
              unique.</t>

              <t>The <xref target="RFC1035">Domain Name System</xref> is not
              the only protocol that may be used for resolving domain
              names.</t>

              <t>Users cannot be assumed to know how to distinguish between
              symbols that have local meaning and symbols that have global
              meaning. Users may therefore share symbols that incorporate
              domain names with no global meaning (for example, a URL of
              'http://mysite.example.corp', where 'example.corp' is a domain
              allocated privately and informally as described in <xref
              target="SDO-ICANN-COLL"/>). Such symbols might refer to the
              object the user intends to share within that user's context, but
              either refer to some other object any recipient's context, or
              might not refer to any object at all in a recipient's context.
              The effect of this is that the user's intended communication
              will not be able to be understood by the recipients of the
              communication. This same problem can also occur simply because a
              single user copies a name from one context in which it has one
              meaning, into a different context in which it has a different
              meaning&mdash; for example copying a '.onion' internet name out
              of a TOR browser, where it has meaning, and pasting this name
              into an ssh client that doesn't support connecting over TOR.
              [TODO: Consider "labels" instead of "symbols".]</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>To boil this down even further, we can take the following advice
          from this document: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Domain names with unambiguous global meaning are preferable
              to domain names with local meaning which will be ambiguous. 
              Nevertheless both globally-meaningful and locally-special names
              are in use and must be supported.</t>

              <t>At the time of the writing of this document the IAB was of
              the opinion that there might well be more than one name
              resolution protocol used to resolve domain names.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Special-Use Domain Names">
          <t>The second important document is <xref target="RFC6761">
          Special-Use Domain Names</xref>. RFC6761 represents the current IETF
          consensus on designating and recording SUINs. The IETF has
          experienced problems with the designation process described in
          RFC6761; these concerns motivate this document. Again, familiarity
          with RFC6761 is a prerequisite for having an informed opinion on the
          topic of SUINs.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 defines two aspects of SUINs: designating a domain name
          to have a special purpose and registering that special use in the
          Special-Use Domain Names registry. The designation process is
          defined in a single sentence (RFC6761, section 4):</t>

          <t><list style="empty">
              <t>If it is determined that special handling of a name is
              required in order to implement some desired new functionality,
              then an IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval" specification
              [RFC5226] MUST be published describing the new
              functionality.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>This sentence implies that any designation of a special-use name
          is subject to the same
          open review and consensus process as used to produce and publish all
          other IETF specifications.</t>

          <t>The registration process is a purely mechanical process, in which
          the existence of the newly designated special use name is recorded,
          with a pointer to a section in the relevant specification document
          that defines the ways in which special handling is to be applied to
          the name.</t>

          <t>RFC6761 provided the process whereby <xref target="RFC6762">
          Multicast DNS</xref>designated ".local" as a special-use name and
          included it in the Special-Use Names registry.   It itself also
          enumerated a set of names that
          had been previously used or defined to have special uses prior to
          the publication of RFC6761.   Since there had been no registry for
          these names prior to the publication of RFC 6761, the documents
          defining these names could not have added them to the registry.</t>

          <t>There are at least several important points to think of with
          respect to the RFC6761: <list style="symbols">
              <t>A special-use name may be a name that should be resolved
              using the DNS protocol with no special handling. An example of
              this is .ARPA.</t>

              <t>A special-use name may be a name that is resolved
              using the DNS protocol, requires no special handling in the
              stub resolver, but requires special handling in the
              recursive resolver.  An example of this would be
              "10.in-addr.arpa."</t>

              <t>A special-use name may be name that requires special handling
              in the stub resolver.  An example would be a special-use top-level
              name like '.local' which acts as a
              signal to indicate that the local stub resolver should use a
              non-DNS protocol for name resolution.</t>

              <t>The current IETF consensus (from a process perspective, not
              necessarily from the perspective of what would be consensus if
              the IETF were to attempt to produce a new consensus document) is
              that these purposes for special-use names are valid.
              [TODO: "Both" implies that there are only two applications; the
              above bullet points outline 3...]</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>RFC6761 does not limit special-use
          names to TLDs. However, at present, all special-use names registered
          in the <xref target="SDO-IANA-SUDR"> IANA Special-Use Domain Names
          registry</xref> are either intended to be resolved using the DNS
          protocol, or are top-level domains, or both. That is, at present
          there exist no special-use names which require special handling by
          stub resolvers and which are not
          at the top level of the naming hierarchy.</t>

          <t>This does mean, however, that at present,
          RFC6762 requires the use of a special label, '.LOCAL', to indicate
          to stub resolvers that mDNS<xref target="RFC6762"/> be used to
          resolve names under that label. <!--- [TODO: Not sure why this is
          considered a corollary?  OK?  TL]--> </t>
        </section>

        <section title="MoU Concerning the Technical Work of the IANA">
          <t>There exists a Memorandum of Understanding<xref
          target="RFC2860"/> between the IETF and ICANN (Internet Corporation
          for Assigned Names and Numbers) which discusses how names and
          numbers will be managed through the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers
          Authority). This document is important to the discussion of SUINs
          because, while it delegates authority for managing the Domain Name
          System Namespace generally to ICANN, it reserves to the IETF the
          authority that RFC 6761 formalizes: <list style="empty">
              <t>Note that (a) assignments of domain names for technical uses
              (such as domain names for inverse DNS lookup), (b) assignments
              of specialised address blocks (such as multicast or anycast
              blocks), and (c) experimental assignments are not considered to
              be policy issues, and shall remain subject to the provisions of
              this Section 4.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The above text is an addendum to the following:
          <list style="empty">
              <t>Two particular assigned spaces present policy issues in
              addition to the technical considerations specified by the IETF:
              the assignment of domain names, and the assignment of IP address
              blocks. These policy issues are outside the scope of this
              MOU.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In general, then, the assignment of names in
          the DNS root zone, and the management of the DNS namespace, is a
          function that is performed by ICANN. However, the
          MoU specifically exempts domain names assigned for technical use,
          and uses the example of 'IN-ADDR.ARPA' and 'IP6.ARPA' to illustrate.
          Both of these names are in the RFC 6761 registry.</t>

          <t>The point here is not to say what the implications of this
          statement in the MoU are, but rather to call the reader's attention
          to the existence of this statement.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Secondary documents relating to the SUTLIN question">
        <t>In addition to these documents, there are several others with which
        participants in this discussion should be familiar.</t>

        <section title="Multicast DNS">
          <t>Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> defines the Multicast DNS
          protocol, which uses the '.LOCAL' SUTLIN. Section 3 describes the
          semantics of "multicast DNS names." It is of considerable historical
          importance to note that the -00 version of this document, an
          individual submission, was published in July of 2001. This version
          contains substantially the same text in section 3, and was discussed
          in the DNSEXT working group at IETF 51 in August of 2001<xref
          target="IETF-PRO-51"/>.   The first version of this document
          designated '.LOCAL.ARPA' as the special-use name.   This idea was
          strongly opposed by DNSEXT working group participants, and as a
          result the author eventually switched to using '.LOCAL'.</t>

          <t>The history of RFC 6762 is documented in substantial detail in
          Appendix H; some notable milestones include the initial proposal to
          replace Appletalk's NBP in July 1997, the chartering of the Zeroconf
          working group in September 1999, allocation of a multicast address
          for link-local name discovery in April of 2000. A companion
          requirements document, eventually published as <xref
          target="RFC6760"/> was first published in September of 2001.</t>

          <t>The point of mentioning these dates is so that discussions
          involving the time when the '.LOCAL' domain was first deployed, and
          the context in which it was deployed, may be properly informed.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The .onion Special-Use TLD">
          <t><xref target="RFC7686">The .onion Special Use TLD</xref> is
          important because it is the most recent IETF action on the topic of
          SUTLINs; although it does not set new policy, the mere fact of its
          publication is worth thinking about.</t>

          <t>Two important points to consider about this document are that:
          <list style="symbols">
              <t>The IETF gained consensus to publish it</t>

              <t>The situation was somewhat forced, both by the fact of its

        <section title="Locally Served DNS Zones">
          <t><xref target="RFC6303">Locally Served DNS Zones</xref> describes
          a particular use case for zones that exist by definition, and that
          are resolved using the DNS protocol, but that cannot have a global
          meaning, because the host IP addresses they reference are not
          unique. This applies to a variety of addresses, including <xref
          target="RFC1918"> Private IPv4 addresses</xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4193">Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses</xref> (in
          which this practice was first described) and <xref
          target="RFC6598">IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address
          Space</xref>.</t>

          <t>This use case is distinct from the use-case for SUTLINs like
          '.local' and '.onion' in that the names are resolved using the DNS
          protocol.  But it shares the problem that such names cannot be assumed
          either to be unique or to be functional in all contexts for all
          internet-connected hosts.</t>

        <section title="Name Collision in the DNS">
          <t><xref target="SDO-ICANN-COLL">Name Collision in the DNS</xref> is
          a study commissioned by ICANN that attempts to characterize the
          potential risk to the Internet of creating a registration process
          for new top-level domains that would allow corporations and persons
          to, for a fee, request a delegation for a particular top-level
          domain. The document concludes that such allocations do present some
          risks, and mentions three specific top-level internet names,
          '.home', '.corp' and '.mail', that present sufficient risk that they
          must never be allocated by ICANN.</t>

        <section title="Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis">
          <t><xref target="RFC7050">Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6
          Address Synthesis</xref> is an example of a document that
          successfully used the RFC 6761 process to designate '.ipv4only.arpa'
          as a special-use name; in this case the process worked smoothly and
          without controversy.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Additional Reserved Top Level Domains">
          <t><xref target="I-D.chapin-additional-reserved-tlds"> Additional
          Reserved Top Level Domains</xref> is an example of a document that
          attempted to reserve several TLDs identified by ICANN as
          particularly at risk for collision as special-use domain names with
          no documented use. This attempt failed.</t>

          <t>Although this document failed to gain consensus to publish, the
          need it was intended to fill still exists.   Unfortunately, although
          a fair amount is known about the use of these names, no document
          exists that documents how they are used, and why it would be a problem
          to allocate them.   Additionally, to the extent that the uses being
          made of these names are valid, no document exists indicating when
          it might make sense to use them, and when it would not make sense
          to use them (the simplest version of this document would of course
          say "never use them."   If that were the IETF consensus, that would
          be a good reason not to bother to publish the document.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Summary">
        <t>The assignment of internet names is not under the sole control of any
        one organization.   ICANN has authority in many cases, and could be
        considered in some sense the default.   IETF has authority in other cases,
        but only with respect to protocol development.   And neither of these
        authorities can in any practical sense exclude the practice of ad-hoc
        allocation of names, which can be done by any entity that has control over
        one or more name servers or resolvers, in the context of any hosts and
        services that that entity operates.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="History">
      <t>Newcomers to the problem of resolving domain names may be under the
      mistaken impression that the DNS sprang, as in the Greek legend of
      Athena, directly from Paul Mockapetris' forehead. This is not the case.
      At the time of the writing of the IAB technical document, memories would
      have been fresh of the evolutionary process that led to the DNS'
      dominance as a protocol for domain name resolution.</t>

      <t>In fact, in the early days of the Internet, hostnames were resolved
      using a text file, HOSTS.TXT, which was maintained by a central
      authority, the Network Information Center, and distributed to all hosts
      on the internet using the <xref target="RFC0959">File Transfer Protocol
      (FTP)</xref>. The inefficiency of this process is cited as a reason for
      the development of <xref target="RFC0882">the DNS</xref>
      <xref target="RFC0883"/> in 1983.</t>

      <t>However, the transition from HOSTS.TXT to the DNS was not smooth. For
      example, <xref target="CORP-SUN-NIS">Sun Microsystems's Network
      Information System</xref>, at the time known as Yellow Pages, was an
      active competitor to the DNS, although it failed to provide a complete
      solution to the global naming problem.</t>

      <t>Another example was NetBIOS Name Service, also known as WINS
      <xref target="RFC1002"/>.   This protocol was used mostly by Microsoft
      Windows machines, but also by open source BSD and Linux operating
      systems to do name resolution using Microsoft's own name resolution
      protocol.</t>
      
      <t>Most modern operating systems can still use the '/etc/hosts' file for
      name resolution. Many still have a name service switch that can be
      configured on the host to resolve some domains using NIS or WINS. Most have the
      capability to resolve names using mDNS by recognizing the special
      meaning of the '.local' SUTLIN.</t>

      <t>The Sun Microsystems model of having private domains within a
      corporate site, while supporting the global domain name system for
      off-site persisted even after the NIS protocol fell into disuse.
      Microsoft used to recommend that site administrators allocate a
      "private" top-level domain for internal use, and this practice was very
      much a part of the zeitgeist at the time. This attitude is the root of
      the widespread practice of simply picking an unused top-level domain and
      using it for experimental purposes, which persists even at the time of
      writing of this memo.</t>

    <section title="Contributors">
      <t>This document came about as a result of conversations that occurred
      the weekend before IETF 95 in the lobby. Stuart Cheshire, Mark Andrews,
      David Conrad, Paul Ebersman and Aaron Falk all made helpful and
      insightful observations or patiently answered questions. This should not
      be taken as an indication that any of these folks actually agree with
      what the document says, but their generosity with time and thought are
      appreciated in any case. Ralph started out as an innocent bystander, but
      discussion with him was the key motivating factor in the writing of this
      document, and he agreed to co-author it without too much arm-twisting.
      And this document owes a great deal to Ed Lewis' excellent work on <xref
      target="I-D.lewis-domain-names">what a "domain name" is</xref>.</t>
