      <t>The Special-Use Domain Names registration policy in RFC 6761 has been
      shown through experience to present unanticipated challenges. This memo
      presents a list, intended to be comprehensive, of the problems that have
      been identified. In addition it reviews the history of Domain Names and
      summarizes current IETF publications and some publications from other
      standards organizations relating to special-use domain names.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>One of the key services required to use the Internet is name
      resolution. Name resolution is the process of translating a
      human-readable symbolic name into some object or set of objects to which
      the name refers, most typically one or more IP addresses. These names
      are often referred to as domain names, although in this document they
      will be referred to as Internet Names to avoid confusion between the
      names and a particular protocol for resolving these names, the <xref
      target="RFC1034">Domain Name System</xref>. An excellent presentation on
      this topic can be found in <xref target="I-D.lewis-domain-names">Domain
      Names</xref>.</t>

      <t>At the time of this writing, the IETF has recently been asked to
      allocate several new special-use top-level Internet Names. In evaluating
      the process for additional special-use top-level Internet Names as
      documented in <xref target="RFC6761">Special-Use Domain Names</xref>,
      the IETF encountered several different sorts of issues. Because of this,
      the IETF has decided to investigate the problem and decide if and how
      the RFC 6761 process can be improved, or whether it should be
      deprecated.</t>

      <t>This document presents a list, believed to be complete, of the
      problems associated with the allocation of special-use names. In support
      of the particular set of problems described here, the document also
      includes documentation of existing practice as it relates to the use of
      Internet Names, as well as a brief history of domain names, and finally
      to describe the set of problems that exist as reported by various IETF
      participants with experience in the various aspects of the problem.</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>For the sake of brevity this document uses a number of abbreviations.
      These are expanded here: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Domain Name">A name which serves as input to a host's
          ordinary name resolution process, for example 'EXAMPLE.ORG'. We are
          avoiding the use of this term because it tends to imply that the
          resolution protocol that will be used is the domain name system.
          However, the actual meaning of this term is identical to the meaning
          of the term 'Internet Name'.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Problems associated with Special-Use Internet Names">
      <t>This section presents a list of problems that have been identified
      with respect to the allocation of special-use names. Solutions to these
      problems are out of scope. Because of that, problems with solutions to
      these problems are also out of scope, and will be covered in a separate
      document.</t>

      <t>No assertion is made that any of these problems is more or less
      important than any other. The point of this is simply to enumerate and
      briefly describe the problems that have been raised during discussions
      of the special-use name problem. The degree of detail is intended to be
      sufficient that that participants in the discussion can agree that the
      problems they've raised have been adequately described, and no more.</t>

      <t>In addition, no assertion is made that all of these problems must be
      addressed; while each problem has one or more solutions, the solutions
      may in some cases be mutually contradictory, or may come with costs that
      do not justify the benefit that would be obtained from solving them.</t>

      <t>This is the list of problems:<list style="symbols">
          <t>IETF and ICANN independently have remit to assign names out of
          the namespace that Internet Names represent; a formal coordination
          process does not exist.</t>

          <t>Although IETF and ICANN nominally have authority over this
          namespace, neither organization can enforce that authority over any
          third party who wants to just start using a subset of the namespace.
          Reasons for doing this may include: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Unaware that a process exists for allocating such names</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by gTLD allocation, but no gTLD
              allocation is ongoing</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by gTLD allocation, don't want to pay
              fee</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by some IETF process, but don't want
              to follow process</t>

              <t>Intended use is covered by ICANN or IETF process, but
              expected outcome is refusal</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>There is demand for more than one name resolution protocol for
          Internet Names, but Internet Names contain no metadata to indicate
          which protocol to use to resolve them.</t>

          <t>When a top-level name is used as a means either of marking the
          rest of an Internet Name for resolution using a protocol other than
          DNS, or is used for resolution of names with no global meaning, not
          all software that processes such names will understand the names'
          special meanings. Consequently, any such use results in queries for
          those names being sent to authoritative servers.</t>

          <t>The RFC6761 process is sufficiently uncertain that some protocol
          developers have assumed they could not get a name assigned; the
          process of assigning the first new name following RFC 6761 took more
          than ten years from beginning to end: longer by a factor of ten than
          any other part of the protocol development process. Other uses of
          the process have proceeded more smoothly, but there is a reasonably
          justified perception that using this process is likely to be slow
          and difficult, with an uncertain outcome.</t>

          <t>There is strong resistance within the IETF to assigning names to
          things outside of the DNS, for a variety of reasons: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Requires a mechanism for identifying which of a set of
              resolution processes is required in order to resolve a
              particular name.</t>

              <t>Assertion of authority: there is a sense that the namespace
              is "owned" by the IETF or by ICANN, and so, if a name is
              allocated outside of that process, the person or entity that
              allocated that name should suffer some consequence that would,
              presumably, deter future circumvention of the official
              process.</t>

              <t>More than one name resolution protocol is bad, in the sense
              that a single protocol is less complicated to implement and
              deploy.</t>

              <t>The semantics of alternative resolution protocols may differ
              from the DNS protocol; DNS has the concept of RRtypes; other
              protocols may not support RRtypes, or may support some entirely
              different data structuring mechanism.</t>

              <t>If there is an IETF process through which a name can be
              allocated at zero cost other than time, this process will be
              used as an alternative to allocating the name through ICANN.</t>

              <t>Some names that might be allocated would be sufficiently
              generic that other legitimate uses of those names would overlap
              with a proposed use, so that assigning the name would preclude
              some future, better use of it.</t>

              <t>If the IETF allocates a name that some third party or parties
              believes belongs to them in some way, the IETF could become
              embroiled in an expensive dispute with those parties.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In cases where the IETF has made assignments through the RFC 6761
          process, technical mistakes have been made due either to
          insufficiently well-defined process or to a failure to follow the
          process that was defined in RFC 6761.</t>

          <t>In principal, the RFC 6761 process could be used to document the
          existence of domain names that are not safe to allocate, and provide
          information on how those names are used in practice. However, <xref
          target="I-D.chapin-additional-reserved-tlds">attempts to use RFC6761
          to accomplish this</xref> have not been successful.</t>

          <t>No process exists for checking documents to make sure they don't
          accidentally assign names (e.g. RFC 7788).</t>

          <t>Use of the registry is inconsistent--some SUTLIN RFCs specify
          registry entries; some don't; some specify delegation, some
          don't.</t>

          <t>There exists no safe, non-process-violating mechanism for ad-hoc
          allocation of special-use names.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 uses the term "Domain Name" to describe the thing for
          which special uses are registered. This creates a great deal of
          confusion because some readers take "Domain Name" to imply the use
          of the DNS protocol.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The problems we have stated here represent the current understanding
      of the authors of the document as to the complete set of problems that
      have been identified during discussion by the working group on this
      topic. The remainder of this document provides additional context that
      will be needed for reasoning about these problems.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Existing Practice Regarding SUINs">
      <t>There are three primary and numerous secondary documents to consider
      when thinking about the Special-Use Internet Names process.</t>

      <section title="Primary SUIN Documents">
        <t>The primary documents are considered primary because they directly
        address the IETF's past thoughts on this topic in a general way, and
        also because they describe what the IETF does in practice. Only one of
        these documents is an IETF consensus document.</t>

        <section title="IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root">
          <t><xref target="RFC2826">This document</xref> is not an IETF
          consensus document, and appears to have been written to address a
          different problem than the SUIN problem. However, it speaks directly
          to several of the key issues that must be considered, and of course
          coming as it does from the IAB, it is rightly given with a great
          deal of authority despite not being an IETF consensus document.</t>

          <t>This document should be considered required reading for IETF
          participants who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of
          SUINs. The main points that appear relevant to the specal use names
          problem are: <list style="symbols">
              <t>The Internet requires a globally unique namespace</t>

              <t>Private networks may operate private namespaces, but still
              require that names in the public namespace be globally
              unique.</t>

              <t>The <xref target="RFC1035">Domain Name System</xref> is not
              the only protocol that may be used for resolving domain
              names.</t>

              <t>Users cannot be assumed to know how to distinguish between
              symbols that have local meaning and symbols that have global
              meaning. Users may therefore share symbols that incorporate
              domain names with no global meaning (for example, a URL of
              'http://mysite.example.corp', where 'example.corp' is a domain
              allocated privately and informally as described in <xref
              target="SDO-ICANN-COLL"/>). Such symbols might refer to the
              object the user intends to share within that user's context, but
              either refer to some other object any recipient's context, or
              might not refer to any object at all in a recipient's context.
              The effect of this is that the user's intended communication
              will not be able to be understood by the recipients of the
              communication. This same problem can also occur simply because a
              single user copies a name from one context in which it has one
              meaning, into a different context in which it has a different
              meaning&mdash; for example copying a '.onion' Internet Name out
              of a TOR browser, where it has meaning, and pasting this name
              into an ssh client that doesn't support connecting over TOR.
              [TODO: Consider "labels" instead of "symbols".]</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>To boil this down even further, we can take the following advice
          from this document: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Domain names with unambiguous global meaning are preferable
              to domain names with local meaning which will be ambiguous.
              Nevertheless both globally-meaningful and locally-special names
              are in use and must be supported.</t>

              <t>At the time of the writing of this document the IAB was of
              the opinion that there might well be more than one name
              resolution protocol used to resolve domain names.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Special-Use Domain Names">
          <t>The second important document is <xref target="RFC6761">
          Special-Use Domain Names</xref>. RFC6761 represents the current IETF
          consensus on designating and recording SUINs. The IETF has
          experienced problems with the designation process described in
          RFC6761; these concerns motivate this document. Again, familiarity
          with RFC6761 is a prerequisite for having an informed opinion on the
          topic of SUINs.</t>

          <t>RFC 6761 defines two aspects of SUINs: designating a domain name
          to have a special purpose and registering that special use in the
          Special-Use Domain Names registry. The designation process is
          defined in a single sentence (RFC6761, section 4):</t>

          <t><list style="empty">
              <t>If it is determined that special handling of a name is
              required in order to implement some desired new functionality,
              then an IETF "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval" specification
              [RFC5226] MUST be published describing the new
              functionality.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>This sentence implies that any designation of a special-use name
          is subject to the same open review and consensus process as used to
          produce and publish all other IETF specifications.</t>

          <t>The registration process is a purely mechanical process, in which
          the existence of the newly designated special use name is recorded,
          with a pointer to a section in the relevant specification document
          that defines the ways in which special handling is to be applied to
          the name.</t>

          <t>RFC6761 provided the process whereby<xref target="RFC6762">
          Multicast DNS</xref>designated ".local" as a special-use name and
          included it in the Special-Use Names registry. It itself also
          enumerated a set of names that had been previously used or defined
          to have special uses prior to the publication of RFC6761. Since
          there had been no registry for these names prior to the publication
          of RFC 6761, the documents defining these names could not have added
          them to the registry.</t>

          <t>There are at least several important points to think of with
          respect to the RFC6761: <list style="symbols">
              <t>A special-use name may be a name that should be resolved
              using the DNS protocol with no special handling. An example of
              this is .ARPA.</t>

              <t>A special-use name may be a name that is resolved using the
              DNS protocol, requires no special handling in the stub resolver,
              but requires special handling in the recursive resolver. An
              example of this would be "10.in-addr.arpa."</t>

              <t>A special-use name may be name that requires special handling
              in the stub resolver. An example would be a special-use
              top-level name like '.local' which acts as a signal to indicate
              that the local stub resolver should use a non-DNS protocol for
              name resolution.</t>

              <t>The current IETF consensus (from a process perspective, not
              necessarily from the perspective of what would be consensus if
              the IETF were to attempt to produce a new consensus document) is
              that these purposes for special-use names are valid. [TODO:
              "Both" implies that there are only two applications; the above
              bullet points outline 3...]</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The term "stub resolver" in this case does not mean "DNS protocol
          stub resolver." The stub resolver is the entity within a particular
          software stack that takes a question about an Internet name and
          answers it. One way a stub resolver can answer such a question is
          using the DNS protocol, but it is in the stub resolver, as we are
          using the term here, that the decision as to whether to use a
          protocol, and if so which protocol, or whether to use a local
          database of some sort, is made.</t>

          <t>RFC6761 does not limit special-use names to TLDs. However, at
          present, all special-use names registered in the <xref
          target="SDO-IANA-SUDR"> IANA Special-Use Domain Names
          registry</xref> are either intended to be resolved using the DNS
          protocol, or are top-level domains, or both. That is, at present
          there exist no special-use names which require special handling by
          stub resolvers and which are not at the top level of the naming
          hierarchy.</t>

          <t>This does mean, however, that at present, RFC6762 requires the
          use of a special label, '.LOCAL', to indicate to stub resolvers that
          mDNS<xref target="RFC6762"/> be used to resolve names under that
          label. <!--- [TODO: Not sure why this is
          considered a corollary?  OK?  TL]--></t>
        </section>

        <section title="MoU Concerning the Technical Work of the IANA">
          <t>There exists a Memorandum of Understanding<xref
          target="RFC2860"/> between the IETF and ICANN (Internet Corporation
          for Assigned Names and Numbers) which discusses how names and
          numbers will be managed through the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers
          Authority). This document is important to the discussion of SUINs
          because, while it delegates authority for managing the Domain Name
          System Namespace generally to ICANN, it reserves to the IETF the
          authority that RFC 6761 formalizes: <list style="empty">
              <t>Note that (a) assignments of domain names for technical uses
              (such as domain names for inverse DNS lookup), (b) assignments
              of specialised address blocks (such as multicast or anycast
              blocks), and (c) experimental assignments are not considered to
              be policy issues, and shall remain subject to the provisions of
              this Section 4.</t>

          <t>The above text is an addendum to the following: <list
              style="empty">
              <t>Two particular assigned spaces present policy issues in
              addition to the technical considerations specified by the IETF:
              the assignment of domain names, and the assignment of IP address
              blocks. These policy issues are outside the scope of this
              MOU.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>In general, then, the assignment of names in the DNS root zone,
          and the management of the DNS namespace, is a function that is
          performed by ICANN. However, the MoU specifically exempts domain
          names assigned for technical use, and uses the example of
          'IN-ADDR.ARPA' and 'IP6.ARPA' to illustrate. Both of these names are
          in the RFC 6761 registry.</t>

          <t>The point here is not to say what the implications of this
          statement in the MoU are, but rather to call the reader's attention
          to the existence of this statement.</t>

      <section title="Secondary documents relating to the SUTLIN question">
        <t>In addition to these documents, there are several others with which
        participants in this discussion should be familiar.</t>

        <section title="Multicast DNS">
          <t>Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> defines the Multicast DNS
          protocol, which uses the '.LOCAL' SUTLIN. Section 3 describes the
          semantics of "multicast DNS names." It is of considerable historical
          importance to note that the -00 version of this document, an
          individual submission, was published in July of 2001. This version
          contains substantially the same text in section 3, and was discussed
          in the DNSEXT working group at IETF 51 in August of 2001<xref
          target="IETF-PRO-51"/>. The first version of this document
          designated '.LOCAL.ARPA' as the special-use name. This idea was
          strongly opposed by DNSEXT working group participants, and as a
          result the author eventually switched to using '.LOCAL'.</t>

          <t>The history of RFC 6762 is documented in substantial detail in
          Appendix H; some notable milestones include the initial proposal to
          replace Appletalk's NBP in July 1997, the chartering of the Zeroconf
          working group in September 1999, allocation of a multicast address
          for link-local name discovery in April of 2000. A companion
          requirements document, eventually published as <xref
          target="RFC6760"/> was first published in September of 2001.</t>

          <t>The point of mentioning these dates is so that discussions
          involving the time when the '.LOCAL' domain was first deployed, and
          the context in which it was deployed, may be properly informed.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The .onion Special-Use TLD">
          <t><xref target="RFC7686">The .onion Special Use TLD</xref> is
          important because it is the most recent IETF action on the topic of
          SUTLINs; although it does not set new policy, the mere fact of its
          publication is worth thinking about.</t>

          <t>Two important points to consider about this document are that:
          <list style="symbols">
              <t>The IETF gained consensus to publish it</t>

              <t>The situation was somewhat forced, both by the fact of its
              unilateral allocation by the TOR project without following the
              RFC 6761 process, and <xref target="SDO-CABF-INT"> because a
              deadline had been set by the CA/Browser Forum</xref> after which
              all .onion PKI certificates would expire and no new certificates
              would be issued, unless the .onion SUTLIN were to be recognized
              by the IETF.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Locally Served DNS Zones">
          <t><xref target="RFC6303">Locally Served DNS Zones</xref> describes
          a particular use case for zones that exist by definition, and that
          are resolved using the DNS protocol, but that cannot have a global
          meaning, because the host IP addresses they reference are not
          unique. This applies to a variety of addresses, including <xref
          target="RFC1918"> Private IPv4 addresses</xref>, <xref
          target="RFC4193">Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses</xref> (in
          which this practice was first described) and <xref
          target="RFC6598">IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address
          Space</xref>.</t>

          <t>This use case is distinct from the use-case for SUTLINs like
          '.local' and '.onion' in that the names are resolved using the DNS
          protocol. But it shares the problem that such names cannot be
          assumed either to be unique or to be functional in all contexts for
          all Internet-connected hosts.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Name Collision in the DNS">
          <t><xref target="SDO-ICANN-COLL">Name Collision in the DNS</xref> is
          a study commissioned by ICANN that attempts to characterize the
          potential risk to the Internet of adding global DNS delegations for
          names that were not previously delegated in the DNS, not reserved
          under any RFC, but also known to be (.local) or surmised to be
          (.corp) in significant use for special-use-type reasons (local scope
          DNS, or other resolution protocols altogether).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis">
          <t><xref target="RFC7050">Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6
          Address Synthesis</xref> is an example of a document that
          successfully used the RFC 6761 process to designate '.ipv4only.arpa'
          as a special-use name; in this case the process worked smoothly and
          without controversy.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Additional Reserved Top Level Domains">
          <t><xref target="I-D.chapin-additional-reserved-tlds"> Additional
          Reserved Top Level Domains</xref> is an example of a document that
          attempted to reserve several TLDs identified by ICANN as
          particularly at risk for collision as special-use domain names with
          no documented use. This attempt failed.</t>

          <t>Although this document failed to gain consensus to publish, the
          need it was intended to fill still exists. Unfortunately, although a
          fair amount is known about the use of these names, no document
          exists that documents how they are used, and why it would be a
          problem to allocate them. Additionally, to the extent that the uses
          being made of these names are valid, no document exists indicating
          when it might make sense to use them, and when it would not make
          sense to use them (the simplest version of this document would of
          course say "never use them." If that were the IETF consensus, that
          would be a good reason not to bother to publish the document.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Summary">
        <t>The assignment of Internet Names is not under the sole control of
        any one organization. ICANN has authority in many cases, and could be
        considered in some sense the default. IETF has authority in other
        cases, but only with respect to protocol development. And neither of
        these authorities can in any practical sense exclude the practice of
        ad-hoc allocation of names, which can be done by any entity that has
        control over one or more name servers or resolvers, in the context of
        any hosts and services that that entity operates.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="History">
      <t>Newcomers to the problem of resolving domain names may be under the
      mistaken impression that the DNS sprang, as in the Greek legend of
      Athena, directly from Paul Mockapetris' forehead. This is not the case.
      At the time of the writing of the IAB technical document, memories would
      have been fresh of the evolutionary process that led to the DNS'
      dominance as a protocol for domain name resolution.</t>

      <t>In fact, in the early days of the Internet, hostnames were resolved
      using a text file, HOSTS.TXT, which was maintained by a central
      authority, the Network Information Center, and distributed to all hosts
      on the Internet using the <xref target="RFC0959">File Transfer Protocol
      (FTP)</xref>. The inefficiency of this process is cited as a reason for
      the development of <xref target="RFC0882">the DNS</xref> <xref
      target="RFC0883"/> in 1983.</t>

      <t>However, the transition from HOSTS.TXT to the DNS was not smooth. For
      example, <xref target="CORP-SUN-NIS">Sun Microsystems's Network
      Information System</xref>, at the time known as Yellow Pages, was an
      active competitor to the DNS, although it failed to provide a complete
      solution to the global naming problem.</t>

      <t>Another example was NetBIOS Name Service, also known as WINS <xref
      target="RFC1002"/>. This protocol was used mostly by Microsoft Windows
      machines, but also by open source BSD and Linux operating systems to do
      name resolution using Microsoft's own name resolution protocol.</t>

      <t>Most modern operating systems can still use the '/etc/hosts' file for
      name resolution. Many still have a name service switch that can be
      configured on the host to resolve some domains using NIS or WINS. Most
      have the capability to resolve names using mDNS by recognizing the
      special meaning of the '.local' SUTLIN.</t>

      <t>The Sun Microsystems model of having private domains within a
      corporate site, while supporting the global domain name system for
      off-site persisted even after the NIS protocol fell into disuse.
      Microsoft used to recommend that site administrators allocate a
      "private" top-level domain for internal use, and this practice was very
      much a part of the zeitgeist at the time. This attitude is the root of
      the widespread practice of simply picking an unused top-level domain and
      using it for experimental purposes, which persists even at the time of
      writing of this memo.</t>

      <t>This history is being presented because discussions about special-use
      names in the IETF often come down to the question of why users of new
      name resolution protocols choose to use Internet names, rather than
      using some other naming concept that doesn't overlap with the namespace
      that, in modern times is, by default, resolved using the DNS.</t>

      <t>The answer is that as a consequence of this long history of resolving
      Internet Names, Internet Names appear in a large variety of contexts in
      user interfaces applications programming interfaces. Any name that
      appears in such a context is an Internet Name. What this means is that
      Internet Names have a highly privileged status in deployed software.
      Proposals to change that will be almost possible to get adopted in a
      useful or consistent way. And since in most operating systems,
      mechanisms already exist for implementing special handling for some
      Internet Names, from a practical perspective the only way to achieve the
      goals of any new name resolution protocol is through the use of
      special-use Internet Names.</t>

    <section title="Contributors">
      <t>This document came about as a result of conversations that occurred
      in the lobby, the weekend before IETF 95. Stuart Cheshire, Mark Andrews,
      David Conrad, Paul Ebersman and Aaron Falk all made helpful and
      insightful observations or patiently answered questions. This should not
      be taken as an indication that any of these folks actually agree with
      what the document says, but their generosity with time and thought are
      appreciated in any case.</t>

      <t>Ralph started out as an innocent bystander, but discussion with him
      was the key motivating factor in the writing of this document, and he
      agreed to co-author it without too much arm-twisting. Warren spent a lot
      of time working with me on this document after it was first published,
      and joined as an author in order to make sure that the work got
      finished; without him the -01 and -02 versions might not have
      happened.</t>

      <t>And this document owes a great deal to Ed Lewis' excellent work on
      <xref target="I-D.lewis-domain-names">what a "domain name"
      is</xref>.</t>
